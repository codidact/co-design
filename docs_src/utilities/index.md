title: Utilities

Co-Design uses "atomic classes" to allow you to specifically modify the presentation of individual elements.

You should be able to create most layouts with these utilities, however some patterns are often repeated. For these, we offer [components](/components). You can, though, override the components with these atomic classes.

Click on any of the entries in the menu, in order to show the utilities for that design area.

Utilities commonly follow the pattern of `.has-[property]-[value]`. In these cases, there's always a short form, which is following the pattern `.h-[property-abbreviation]-[value]`.
